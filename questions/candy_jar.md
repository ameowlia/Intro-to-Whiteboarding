#Counting Candy

Filling Jars:
You have a bunch of jars labeled 1 to N.

You are given a set of instructions detailing how much candy to put in each jar.

After you finish all the instructions, you need to return the average number of candies in each jar.

*Example Input:* [5,[1,2,100],[2,5,100],[3,4,100]]

5 #=> [0,0,0,0,0]

1, 2, 100 #=>[100,100,0,0,0]

2, 5, 100 #=>[100,200,100,100,100]

3, 4, 100 #=>[100,200,200,200,100]

*Example Output:* 160
