#Recursive permutation

A permutation, also called an "arrangement number" or "order," is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list into a one-to-one correspondence with itself.

Example: dogs
dogs sgod gsod ogsd
dosg sgdo gsdo ogds
dsgo sdgo gdso osdg
dsog sdog gdos osgd
dgso sodg gods odgs
dgos sogd gosd odsg

Please write a method to print out all permutations of a string of uniq characters.

PS. this is the problem to practice your recursion skill, you are welcome to solve in Ruby or JavaScript.

Hint: you can use a combination of looping and recursion, or use trie with recursion.
