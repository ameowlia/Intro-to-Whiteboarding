#Are Anagrams?
Write the method are_anagrams? that takes two strings as arguments and returns true if they are anagrams of each other or false if they are not. 

Explain the time and space complexity of your algorithm.


**Examples:**
```code
are_anagrams?(“dbc”, “cdb”) #=> true
are_anagrams?(“dbc”, “pizzarules”) #=> false
```

**Bonus:** Can you do it without using the Ruby method #sort?
